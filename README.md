### INSTALLATION

No need to install, just extract where you want it, double click and allow it to set defaults and open any image on your drive from explorer.

This is just for quick viewing of images and is not meant for editing or any major photo stuff. Just a simple photo viewer.

I based this off of [Fastly-Image-Viewer](https://github.com/Rebzzel/Fastly-Image-Viewer) and just completely redid it. His is great but I needed it to be a particular way.
